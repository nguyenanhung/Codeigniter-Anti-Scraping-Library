# Codeigniter-Anti-Scraping-Library

Protecting your content from illegal scraping is not so difficult. Anti-Scraping works just like how Google works, detects users' behavior and analyzes users' information such as:

- IP address
- IP address's resolved Hostname
- Session cookie
- Javascript cookie
- User-agent
- PHP HTTP_REFERER varible

If an user reached the limit of your settings, Anti-Scraping will ban it. 
By default, Anti-Scraping allow popular search englines, Google and Bing, their crawlers' IP can be resolved to hostname and easy to identify.
