# Codeigniter-Anti-Scraping-Library

Protecting your content from illegal scraping is not so difficult. Anti-Scraping works just like goole, detects users' behavior and analyzes users' information such as:

(1) IP address
(2) IP's resolved hostname
(3) Session cookie
(4) Javascript cookie
(5) User-agent
(6) PHP HTTP_REFERER varible

If an user reached the limit of your settings, Anti-Scraping will ban it. 
By default, Anti-Scraping allow popular search englines, Google and Bing, their crawlers' IP can be resolved to hostname and easy to identify.
